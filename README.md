# EasyRitorno

## Introduction
A web portal to help end users have a hassle-free retail return experience. Once the customer logs into the portal, he/she identifies the type of goods he/she wishes to return. The customer places an order for the number boxes or packaging type required. The customer is also given an option to opt the type of shipping (1-day shipping, 2-day shipping, standard shipping). The portal houses an option to upload the return shipping label. The customer specifies the pick-up time and pick-up address. The customer then places an order for the service. The packaging charges, shipping charges and service charge is payable through PayPal. The customer is then provided with a tracking number using which he/she can verify the status of his package. Once the package is picked up and shipped to the appropriate address, customers are notified and can tweet their experience about the service provided.

Single Sign On implemented using ADFS for web application, Github, Jenkins, JIRA, Bamboo, BitBucket and Confluence. CI/CD solution implemented using Jenkins. Junit framework for unit testing. Logging using Log4J.
